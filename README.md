## installing PyOpenGL (for windows at least)
- don't install the one on conda/pip
- download the relevant binary linked to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59725675/need-to-install-pyopengl-windows) (i.e. 39 is version 3.9) (note: the acclerate version doesn't seem to have GLUT?)
- run `pip install PyOpenGL-3.1.6---.whl`
